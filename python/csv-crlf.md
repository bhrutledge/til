# Writing CSV files without CRLF

```python
writer = csv.DictWriter(sys.stdout, fieldnames=fieldnames, lineterminator="\n")
writer.writeheader()
writer.writerows(rows)
```

Without `lineterminator`, lines will end with `\r\n`, which can result in:

```
$ git add .
fatal: CRLF would be replaced by LF in test.csv
```

It might be preferable to use `os.linesep`, instead of `"\n"`, but I don't know if that's the correct behavior on Windows.

# Record terminal sessions with asciinema

"[asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) is a free and open source solution for recording terminal sessions and sharing them on the web", using "a lightweight, purely text-based approach".

For example: [an asciinema recording of using asciinema to record a demo of ipython](https://asciinema.org/a/354787). ðŸ˜‰

Unfortunately, recordings can't be embedded directly in Markdown files or GitHub issues and PRs. Instead, use [asciicast2gif](https://github.com/asciinema/asciicast2gif) to generate GIF animations from asciinema recordings.

Here's a GIF of the recording above, which shows running `asciinema` followed by `asciicast2gif`:

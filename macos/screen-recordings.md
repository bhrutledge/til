# Recording the screen in macOS

Use [Shift-Command-5](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721) to make a video recording (or capture a still image) of the entire screen, or just a selected portion of it.

Unfortunately, videos can't always be uploaded/embedded where you'd like to, such as [GitHub issues and PRs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests). Instead, use another utility to make an animated GIF of a video recording; [Kap](https://getkap.co/) is an excellent open-source option.

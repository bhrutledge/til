# Drink coffee at lower temperature

According to [The Ideal Temperature to Drink Coffee](https://driftaway.coffee/temperature/):

- "At any temperature above 150°F, it is difficult to taste the coffee itself"
- "Coffee’s notes shine between 120°F and 140°F"

For years, I've been taking my first sips of coffee within 30 seconds of finishing the Aeropress brew. A thermometer tells me that can be close to 170°F! Depending on the size of the brew and the mug that I use, it takes 8-10 minutes for the temperature to get close to 140°F.

This is a game-changer for my experience of coffee.

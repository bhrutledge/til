# Brew coffee with boiling water

According to [James Hoffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_r5kpXPRYo), it's fine (if not better) to use water right off the boil for the light roasts that I prefer. This is because it cools immediately in the brewer, and there isn't a concern about extracting bitter flavors like there might be with darker roasts.

For years, I've been using a thermometer or variable temperature scale to brew coffee in my Aeropress at ~192Â°F, because somewhere I heard that was the ideal temperature. This simplifies my cofee routine. Yay!

Of course, there's room for experimentation:
